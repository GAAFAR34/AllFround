#### Project description 
AllFound is a mobile app that provides household services to customers. Whether it's cleaning, technical issues, or other common household tasks, AllFound connects customers with reliable service providers who are experts in their respective fields.

The app has a user-friendly interface that allows customers to search for services by location and category. When a customer needs a specific service, they can simply enter their location, select the category of service they require, and browse through a list of qualified service providers nearby. Each provider's profile contains information about their experience, ratings and reviews, and the services they offer.

AllFound also allows service providers to create a profile and advertise their services to potential customers. Service providers can add their qualifications, certifications, and availability to their profile, making it easier for customers to find them. They can also respond to customer requests and inquiries directly through the app, making communication seamless and efficient.

The app also includes a feature that allows customers to schedule appointments with service providers directly through the app. Customers can choose a specific date and time that works best for them, and the service provider can confirm or adjust the appointment as needed. This feature eliminates the need for back-and-forth communication and streamlines the entire scheduling process.

Overall, AllFound is an all-in-one app that connects customers with household service providers quickly and easily. It provides a convenient and efficient way for customers to find reliable help for their household needs, and for service providers to expand their business and reach new customers.
